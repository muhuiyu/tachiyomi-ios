# Tachiyomi iOS App
Welcome to the Tachiyomi iOS App project, inspired by the Android application of the same name [Tachiyomi](https://tachiyomi.org/). Tachiyomi, which means "standing reading" in Japanese (立ち読み), is designed to provide a seamless manga reading experience on iOS devices.

## Project Overview
The Tachiyomi iOS App allows users to browse, read, and manage their favorite manga from various online sources. The application's main goal is to recreate the functionality and user experience of the original Android version, while optimizing it for the iOS ecosystem.

## Current Features
The app is structured with five main tabs, each serving a unique purpose:

1. Library: Your personal collection of manga. Browse, organize, and access your saved titles.
2. Updates: Keep track of recent updates to the manga in your library.
3. History: View your reading history and quickly resume where you left off.
4. Browse: Discover new manga from a variety of online sources.
5. Settings: Customize your reading experience, manage app settings, and handle account preferences.

## Ongoing Development
The project is actively being developed, with the following key features currently in progress:
- [] Updates, History, and Account Tabs: Enhancing these sections with additional functionalities ad user interface improvements.
- [] Download Manga Locally: Implementing offline reading capabilities by allowing users to download manga chapters to their device.

## Technology Stack
- Swift
- UIKit (with a plan to support SwiftUI for future enhancements)
- Networking libraries for fetching manga data from online sources

## Future Plans
- Expand source compatibility to cover more manga websites.
- Integrate social features for community engagement.
- Explore the potential for an iPad-specific layout.
